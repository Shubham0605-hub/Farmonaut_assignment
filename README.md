## App Description
The app is a responsive web page that features a functional menu with multiple items that change the main area content on the right side. Menu 1 displays four cards designed to be similar to a provided image, while the other menu items only show the item number.

Users can add new first and last names to the app, creating a new card on the page. They can update and delete names, and any changes will immediately reflect on the page. All data for the cards comes from APIs and is stored in a database of the user's choice, accessed through an API endpoint that can be developed on Flask (Python) or any other framework of the user's choice.

The app is designed to work seamlessly on all major platforms, including mobile phones, tablets, laptops, and desktops. Clicking on the app's logo opens Menu 1. If connecting to a database is too complex, users can store data in the Flask app, or use local dummy data instead of APIs.

Overall, the app is a fully functional and responsive web page that provides users with a straightforward and user-friendly experience for displaying and managing data.
